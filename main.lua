    Tic Tac Toe

    Date: December 26, 2024

    This is my third attempt at making this, my last two were sadly lost to the void for various unfortunate events.
    Let's hope it fucking works :)

    Game Initialization
        Create the game board as a 3x3 array or a 1D array of 9 elements.
        Define player symbols (e.g., "X" for the player, "O" for the AI).
        Initialize variables to track the current turn and game state (ongoing, win, draw).

    Display the Board
        Write a function to print the game board to the console.
        Ensure the board updates and displays after each move.

    Player Input
        Write a function to handle player input:
            Prompt the player for a move (e.g., a number from 1â€“9).
            Validate that the input is within range and the cell is empty.
            Update the board with the player's symbol.

    AI Logic
        Write a function to determine the AI's move:
            Start with random moves on empty cells.
            Optional: Add logic to prioritize winning moves or block the player.
            Optional: Implement strategic moves (e.g., choose the center or corners).

    Game State Check
        Write a function to check for win conditions:
            Check rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols.
        Write a function to check for a draw:
            Ensure all cells are filled and there's no winner.

    Game Loop
        Create a loop to alternate turns between the player and the AI:
            Display the board at the start of each turn.
            Check if the game has been won or is a draw.
            Execute the current turn's move (player input or AI logic).
            Switch turns.

    End Game
        Display a message indicating the winner or a draw.
        Offer an option to restart or exit the game.

    Optional Enhancements:
        Allow row/column input (e.g., A1, B2) for moves.
